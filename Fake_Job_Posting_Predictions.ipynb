    "Indeed.com has just hired you to create a system that automatically flags suspicious job postings on it's website. It has recently seen an influx of fake job postings that is negativley impacting it's customer experience. Becuase of the high volume of job postings it receives everyday, their employees do have the capacity to check every posting so they would like prioritize which postings to review before deleting it. \n",

    "#### Your task\n",
    "Use the attached dataset with NLP to create an alogorthim which automatically flags suspicious posts for review. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data\n",
    "This dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs.\n",
